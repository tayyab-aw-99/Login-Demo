# LEI SHING HONG ‚Äì Login Page Automation Testing

This project demonstrates automated functional testing of the **LEI SHING HONG** web application‚Äôs **login page** using **Selenium WebDriver** with **Java** and **TestNG**. The goal of this automation is to verify the login functionality, ensure element accessibility, validate navigation flow, and confirm successful authentication for valid credentials.

## üß© Project Overview

The test script automates the following workflow:
1. Launches the Chrome browser using **WebDriverManager** (no manual driver setup required).
2. Navigates to the LEI SHING HONG organization‚Äôs web portal:  
   `https://organization-frotnend3-gold.vercel.app/`
3. Locates and interacts with login form elements ‚Äî **username**, **password**, and **login button**.
4. Submits valid credentials:
   - **Email:** `a**********.com`  
   - **Password:** `*******`
5. Validates successful login by verifying the redirected URL contains:  
   `/admin/UltimateHoldingCompany`
6. Closes the browser session after execution.
